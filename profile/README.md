## 👋 Hey, welcome to Devtranet 

![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90291337/229528959-7a0a8faf-a151-44be-b40b-39ac21dd3900.png)

The tools developers and people in tech need to build careers and connections are heavily fragmented, they combine at least five disjointed tools to do so, and we're making it easier than ever! We solve this problem and help enterprises cut costs, save on headcount, and move faster across DevRel & technical recruiting with the power of AI.

We decided to build Devtranet for millions of people like us. Designers connect on Dribbble and Behance while developers browse through StackOverflow to find solutions to coding problems. With chatGPT and GitHub Copilot becoming smarter day by day, it's high time for developers and people in tech to call a place home, and we want _*Devtranet*_ to be that place. Imagine being stuck in a chat window or code editor for days without any connection with like-minded people 💀

## 👨‍💻 It's 2023, but as a Developer:

- You need a LinkedIn account for networking or your job search, and you can't escape recruiters spam.

- To showcase all the cool projects you've shipped, you need to code a portfolio from scratch and pay for a domain name plus web hosting. Something people spend less than five minutes taking a look at except if your UI designer friend helps with a good template. 

- StackOverflow isn't open to subjective questions or beginner-friendly ones. Try asking “How can I improve the performance of my web app?” while I watch you get downvoted or banned, but we all need help. 

- Looking for collaborators for a project? You have to ask people on literally all the Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp dev communities you're part of. What if it can be done at the tap of a button?

- Need to learn a new technology? It's on YouTube for free but you can't watch it without disturbance: Ads, Ads, Ads…

- Blogging or sharing your thought leadership is a hassle. You have to keep migrating from Medium or Substack to the next promising dev blogging platform to remove paywalls, Ads, and own your content.           

We're changing all this with Devtranet, our grand vision is to become the home for developers and people in tech.

## Join us and build the home for developers and people in tech 👨‍💻🚀

We know the tech community, and we’re more than excited to spend the next 15-20 years connecting people in tech through Devtranet. We can build whatever we dream of with code, turn users into communities, and communities into a network with our third co-founder, **YOU**, yes, _*you*_ contributing to this codebase!
