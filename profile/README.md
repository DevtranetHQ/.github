## 👋 Hey, welcome to Devtranet

We're building a new place for developers to connect, share projects, blog, and find collaborators. Today, millions of people like us spend hours every day switching between different tools which results in a fragmented experience and lost productivity. Building a career for an extremely challenging job shouldn't be that hard — we're making it easier than ever!

There are plenty of developer communities and tools, but they are too focused on specific problems: Hashnode is a great modern blogging platform, StackOverflow is where we go to find help (before ChatGPT 😂). Everyone wants to become a 10x developer but so many things are getting in the way, it's high time for developers and people in tech to call a place home, and we want _*Devtranet*_ to be that place. 

Devtranet gives developers a community and tools to connect, build, and discover opportunities. 

## 👨‍💻 It's 2024, but as a Developer:

- You need a LinkedIn account for networking or your job search, and you can't escape recruiter's spam.

- To showcase all the cool projects you've shipped, you need to code a portfolio from scratch and pay for a domain name plus web hosting. Something people spend less than five minutes taking a look at except if your UI designer friend helps with a good template. 

- StackOverflow isn't open to subjective questions or beginner-friendly ones. Try asking “How can I improve the performance of my web app?” while I watch you get downvoted or banned, but we all need help. 

- Looking for collaborators for a project? You have to ask people on literally all the Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp dev communities you're part of. What if it can be done at the tap of a button?

- Need to learn a new technology? It's on YouTube for free but you can't watch it without disturbance: Ads, Ads, Ads…

- Blogging or sharing your thought leadership is a hassle. You have to keep migrating from Medium or Substack to the next promising dev blogging platform to remove paywalls, Ads, and own your content.           

We're changing all this with Devtranet, our grand vision is to become the home for developers and people in tech.

## Join us and build the home for developers and people in tech 👨‍💻🚀

We know the tech community, and we’re more than excited to spend the next 15-20 years connecting people in tech through Devtranet. We can build whatever we dream of with code, turn users into communities, and communities into a network with our third co-founder, **YOU**, yes, _*you*_ contributing to this codebase!
