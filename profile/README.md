## üëã Hey, welcome to Devtranet 

![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90291337/229528959-7a0a8faf-a151-44be-b40b-39ac21dd3900.png)

The tools developers and people in tech need to build careers and connections are heavily fragmented, they combine at least five disjointed tools to do so, and we're making it easier than ever! We solve this problem and also help enterprises cut costs, save on headcount, and move faster across DevRel & technical recruiting.

We decided to build Devtranet for millions of people like us. Designers connect on Dribbble and Behance while developers browse through StackOverflow to find solutions to coding problems. With chatGPT and GitHub Copilot becoming smarter day by day, it's high time for developers and people in tech to call a place home, and we want _*Devtranet*_ to be that place. Imagine being stuck in a chat window or code editor for days without any connection with like-minded people üíÄ

## üë®‚Äçüíª It's 2023, but as a Developer:

- You need a LinkedIn account for networking or your job search, and you can't escape recruiters spam.

- To showcase all the cool projects you've shipped, you need to code a portfolio from scratch and pay for a domain name plus web hosting. Something people spend less than five minutes taking a look at except if your UI designer friend helps with a good template. 

- StackOverflow isn't open to subjective questions or beginner-friendly ones. Try asking ‚ÄúHow can I improve the performance of my web app?‚Äù while I watch you get downvoted or banned, but we all need help. 

- Looking for collaborators for a project? You have to ask people on literally all the Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp dev communities you're part of. What if it can be done at the tap of a button?

- Need to learn a new technology? It's on YouTube for free but you can't watch it without disturbance: Ads, Ads, Ads‚Ä¶

- Blogging or sharing your thought leadership is a hassle. You have to keep migrating from Medium or Substack to the next promising dev blogging platform to remove paywalls, Ads, and own your content.           

## ü§î Why our team?

I‚Äôve spent over 5 years building global developer and tech communities as well as organizing some of the world‚Äôs largest developer-centric events, from where I got the idea for Devtranet. 

This fragmentation also extends to communities, where you belong determines the type of career opportunities you get, the quality of support you receive, your network, and more.

Jakub worked as a Senior engineer at Google and Roblox, building software for millions of users for over 5 years. Like many other developers, there were a lot of times when he felt lost, and almost gave up because he could only search for solutions to problems on StackOverflow, there was no way for him to connect with like-minded people. Our experience combined with our passion for solving a problem that has affected us differently makes us the perfect team for Devtranet.

## üõ† What we've built before Devtranet

Jakub <a href="https://twitter.com/Dphenomenal_101/status/1637740402445828096" rel="nofollow">left Google </a> to join Devtranet, he is the original creator of Phantom Forces which now has 1 billion views and 8k real-time players daily. At 18, he was accepted to MIT, Columbia, and other Ivy Leagues at the same time he got offers from Google and Dell.

When I was 17, I organized < a href="https://codetivate.devtranet.tech" Codetivate</a>, one of the world's largest hackathons, which hosted over 1,700 developers from 70+ countries, after raising over half a million dollars in monetary and in-kind support from thirty companies, Intel's first maker researcher, two Forbes 30 under 30, and a Thiel Fellow whose maker community is backed by the founder of GitHub and Elon Musk. 

In less than a year, I grew <a href="https://genztechies.com" rel="nofollow">GenZtechies </a> into Africa‚Äôs largest network for Gen-Zs in tech shortly after founding The Dynamics to empower underprivileged makers and hackers around the world, since then it has reached over half a million hackers.

My recent work is the Gen Z HackFest 2022 which hosted 2,500+ developers and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GenZHackfest2022?src=hashtag_click" rel="nofollow">reached over a million </a> individuals from Africa and beyond with support from developer-centric companies like Filecoin. 

## Some final words 

We know the tech community, and we‚Äôre more than excited to spend the next 15-20 years connecting people in tech through Devtranet. We can build whatever we dream of with code, turn users into communities, and communities into a network with our third co-founder, **YOU**, yes, _*you*_ contributing to this codebase!
